# Usage

## About
This is a deployment of the Balkan Family Tree application https://balkan.app/FamilyTreeJS served in Github Pages.


## Local development
```docker build .```

Then

```docker compose up -d```

## Updating the tree
The tree file is currently at js/data.json. I'm taking suggestions on moving it out of the repository in favor of a more secure location.

For now check in directly to the `main` branch. If there is enough traction and contribution, we can discuss a workflow for PRs and merges.
